hey there, and welcome to [thingsilearnedtoday](http://thingsilearnedtoday.github.io). let me tell you what's going on around here.

## who am I?

my name is Vlad Zelinschi.

I'm a front-end engineer at [Yonder](http://tss-yonder.com/) who loves spending his day coding cool stuff and drinking good coffee. and writing every sentence in lowercase...apart for names and the english word I.

## ok, so what's up with this site?

the story begins with me being really, really bad at remembering things.

I read a lot of cool stuff (mostly technology related) every day, and I noticed I have a hard time keeping track with all the knowledge after a certain period.

while some say this is normal, I don't find it acceptable. it's like 85% of my effort is gone within 4 weeks or so.
to mitigate this problem, I obviously...read about it. I found out some cool techniques I aleardy started trying, but it takes some time to get results.

one thing I always find helpful is writing stuff down. so I though why not make short notes of all the nice things I read about. and make them available to everyone. maybe someone else will find something useful among them.

that's how [thingsilearnedtoday](http://thingsilearnedtoday.github.io) was born. it's the place where I lay down  thoughts, ideas, links, short comments, etc. reagrding programming knowledge mostly, but not limited to.

## what can I find around here?

I'm a front-end guy. in love with front-end actually. so expect some HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be present. I also dig Angular, Node and Mongo. and I'm a performance geek. so these are definately on the list too.

you might also encounter from time to time, non technical things. if you care to read them (or follow the links), do so. if not, you are free to skip past them.

## summary

think of this site as a very short go-to list of daily practical front-end resources/knowlegde. the goal is to spend little time reading concise information. and I hope you will find some of it useful.

thanks!
